# IPv6-Subnet-Calculator-Tool-Java
IPv6 Subnet Calculator/Tool with **Java JDK 17**   
**Latest Version: 4.0**     
Release Date: **23 May 2022**    

IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool application lets you plan/subnet your assigned address for all 128 bits.  

We are in the transition phase of our networks addressing structure from IPv4 to IPv6, and I believe that the network engineers should easily plan their IPv6 addressing /subnetting infrastructure without any error. For this purpose, I wrote and distributed a free IPv6 Subnetting Tool / Calculator both with C# and Java JDK 17 Application Frameworks. I distributed the applications in the hope that it will be useful for your subnet calculations. I will try to develop the software continuously, so please don't hesitate to comment/inform for any bugs or new feature suggestions.
